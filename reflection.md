What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

To begin this code, it was extremely useful to thoroughly follow the procedural resale shop file, and to confirm that each attribute and function made practical sense to me in terms of the assignment demands. I also found the OneCard file we reviewed in class to be my starting reference point. As most of my mistakes came from accidental overlooking of code that needed to be rewritten, I would suggest to someone taking this course in the future to make a seperate checklist that simply concerns code structure within the file. What I mean by this is to confirm that the necessary import has been stated in the "from file" function and that all necessary attributes are defined by OOP style "self.", rewritten from"[()]" form. Although this was in fact frusturating in trying to correct the error messages and not having one bit of python knowledge beyond what we've covered in class thus far, I'm very pleased that I understand every one of my mistakes. I thought that this assignment could be squeezed in last minute, but I was wrong––and in fact the most learning I did was in the hour that I spent trying to correct my error messages.
